What is Bull vs. Bear?
Bull vs. Bear is a narrative trading platform that allows anyone to run Long-Short strategies in one transaction using USDC as collateral. 100% of your USDC earns lending yield while you trade.

What are the risks?
Bull vs. Bear uses Mars Protocol to enable users to execute leveraged Long-Short strategies in a single transaction. Trading with leverage involves borrowing funds from the platform, which increases both potential gains and risks. If the asset price moves significantly against your position, your trade may be liquidated to cover the borrowed funds. Before trading, ensure you fully understand how leverage works and never risk more than you can afford to lose.

How do positions work?
A position is a Long-Short trade that you've opened or closed on Bull vs. Bear. Your position's profit and loss (PnL) will increase or decrease based on the price movements of the assets you longed and shorted. You can monitor the details and performance of your open positions at the bottom of the Trade page. Here, you can manage and share your position with your friends on Twitter/X.

What is liquidation?
Liquidation occurs when an open position is automatically closed because its value has dropped too far relative to the borrowed amount. This ensures the platform can recover the borrowed funds. The liquidation price is shown for each position.

What is the minimum amount of USDC I can deposit?
The minimum position size for each trading pair is $10. You can either use at least 10 USDC as collateral or a smaller amount with leverage. For example, with 4x leverage, you could open a position with just 5 USDC, making the total trade value $20.

Are positions cross-collateralized?
No, positions are not cross-collateralized. Each position is managed independently, meaning the collateral for one trade will not be used to support another. This ensures liquidation risk is contained within individual positions rather than affecting your entire account.

How do clusters work?
Cryptocurrencies are often driven by narratives. Clusters make it easy to trade on narratives by bundling multiple long and short positions into one. Each cluster contains a mix of assets with custom weights — for example, a 50/50 BTC-ETH long cluster would use 50% of the money to long BTC and 50% to long ETH.

To trade clusters:

Deposit USDC (it will earn lending yield while you trade)
Select a pre-made cluster or create your own by selecting long and short tokens
Choose your size and leverage
Confirm your trade
Clusters use leverage, which involves borrowing funds from the platform, increasing potential gains and risks. If an asset price within a cluster moves significantly against your position, your cluster trade may be liquidated to cover the borrowed funds. You can monitor your performance, track liquidation prices, and manage your cluster positions on the Trade and Cluster tabs.


What is funding?
Funding rates are periodic payments between long and short traders in leveraged markets, designed to keep contract prices aligned with the underlying assets. When the rate is positive, long positions pay shorts; when negative, shorts pay longs.

## Strategic Trading with Bull vs. Bear

Bull vs. Bear is Neutron's innovative trading platform that enables users to create and execute sophisticated long-short strategies through narrative-based Clusters. It provides a powerful way to gain targeted exposure to specific market narratives without managing multiple individual positions.

## What are Clusters?


  Clusters are strategic groupings of multiple long and short positions packaged into a single tradable unit. This allows traders to express directional views on broader market narratives or trends, rather than individual assets.

## How Clusters Work

Clusters allow you to express complex market views through unified positions:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Market Narrative] --> B[Cluster Creation]
    B --> C[Long Positions]
    B --> D[Short Positions]
    C --> E[Asset 1 - Long]
    C --> F[Asset 2 - Long]
    D --> G[Asset 3 - Short]
    D --> H[Asset 4 - Short]
    E --> I[Single Tradable Position]
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

For example, if you believe in Bitcoin dominance increasing:
1. Create a Cluster that goes long on Bitcoin
2. Add short positions on altcoins you expect to underperform
3. Set your preferred weights for each position
4. Trade the entire Cluster as a single unit

Frequently Asked Questions

What is Bull vs. Bear?

What are the risks?
Bull vs. Bear uses Mars Protocol to enable users to execute leveraged Long-Short strategies in a single transaction. Trading with leverage involves borrowing funds from the platform, which increases both potential gains and risks. If the asset price moves significantly against your position, your trade may be liquidated to cover the borrowed funds. Before trading, ensure you fully understand how leverage works and never risk more than you can afford to lose.

How do positions work?
A position is a Long-Short trade that you've opened or closed on Bull vs. Bear. Your position's profit and loss (PnL) will increase or decrease based on the price movements of the assets you longed and shorted. You can monitor the details and performance of your open positions at the bottom of the Trade page. Here, you can manage and share your position with your friends on Twitter/X.
